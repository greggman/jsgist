# To Do

- [ ] try not making a new iframe each run (they show up in the debugger)
- [ ] add stack trace to all the logs?
- [ ] errors automatically go to line?
- [ ] handle back (need to notice back and re-load)
- [ ] allow pop-out result to separate window.
- [ ] save README with link. If user made a readme use that instead though sub {{link}} for link
  
  (we can't do this unless we double save on create as we need to know the gist id to make the link)
