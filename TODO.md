O fix embed
O add avatar to embed
O handle back (need to notice back and re-load)
x show avatar
  O figure out what to do on new
    the issue is the avatar is for the jsgist, not the user
    so when you click new what should show because at that point
    here is no user.
O allow pop-out result to separate window.
O save README with link. If user made a readme use that instead though sub {{link}} for link
  (we can't do this unless we double save on create as we need to know the gist id to make the link)
